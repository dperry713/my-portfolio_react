      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Dustin Perry. I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in security policies, threat intelligence, and risk analysis. I am seeking a challenging Security Analyst role to leverage my skills in protecting organizational assets and implementing robust security measures. I am interested in anything tech-related and also love to build and fix cars and motorcycles.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goals for my career are to become a full stack developer or cybersecurity engineer. I feel like I would really enjoy doing either and am very eager to be in a position that will enable me to showcase the skills I've acquired throughout my academic journey thus far.
